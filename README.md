# Lifelike

Lifelike is an open source project that aims to provide a simple, yet powerful platform for turning structured and unstructured data from a variety of sources into a single, coherent and explorable knowledge graph.


## Getting started

### Quick Start

The easiest way to get started and run a fully functional development environment of Lifelike is to clone this repository and run the `make up` command.

```shell
$ make up
```

This will take a few minutes to complete, after which you can start using Lifelike by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Other installation methods

To deploy Lifelike in a production environment or customize installation, you can see the available methods described in the [Installation](install-manifests) section.


## Lifelike concepts

### Projects

Lifelike organizes content into projects. A project is a filesystem-like collection of resources either uploaded by users or generated by Lifelike based on other resources. Those resources can be all kinds of data, including structured data like spreadhseets, unstructured data like PDF files, images or text documents.

### Knowledge Domains

Lifelike structures knowledge around domains. A domain is a collection of semantically related entities belonging to a field of study.


### Annotations

Annotations are a powerfull way to attach context to your data in knowledge Domains.

### Knowledge Graph

Generated knowledge is organized in a Knowledge graph. A knowledge graph consist of nodes and edges. Nodes are domain entities and edges are relations between entities


### Visualizations

Visualizations are a powerful way to help you to understand the relationships between entities as well as a powerful tool to find new relationships as new data comes in.

Lifelike currenty provides the following built-in visualization types:

- Maps
- Enrichment tables
- Sankey diagrams

## Architecture

Lifelike is a distributed system comprised of the following components:

### Services and components

- Backend appserver
- Frontend client application
- Statistical enrichment service
- PostgreSQL
- Neo4j
- Elasticsearch
- PDFParser
