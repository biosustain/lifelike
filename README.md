# FLASK - NEO4J BOILERPLATE

Sets up a Dockerized Flask and Neo4j application using ```docker-compose``` for experimenting. Flask and Neo4j communication is done through **py2neo**.

To run the application, use ```docker-compose up```

## TODO
- ~~Add an example API endpoint using py2neo~~
  - *See blueprints directory*
- ~~Add a JavaScript client~~
  - *Angular 2 added as a client*
- Compelely remove 'template' folders from application server
- Handle neo4j transactions
- Add Angular Material for styling
- Middleware to translate ```vis.js``` data to be compatible with ```py2neo (neo4j)```
- Implement DTU Navigation bar
- Adding NgRx (Redux) to the stack
- Handle saving vis.js data to Neo4J

## Considerations
- Adding GraphQL to the stack
