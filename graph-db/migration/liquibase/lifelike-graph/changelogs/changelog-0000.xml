      Add new property original_entity_types to entity nodes.
      This is to help with deleting global inclusion, to avoid deleting a real relationship.
      The reason for this was because during testing, a global inclusion was mistakenly added as
      a certain type, resulting in a node with two type, one real and one fake. This means that node
      now returns back as a synonym for both types.
