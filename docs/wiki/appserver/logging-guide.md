# Flask Logging

## Overview
All logs generated are sent to stdout and stderr streams. These logs can be seen in Docker via
```bash
docker logs -f appserver
```

In staging and production, these logs are captured by Filebeat which sends the Docker logs to Logstash for processing. The ELK stack can currently be found at https://elk.prod.lifelike.bio.

We're currently using ELK mainly for INFO logs (although its catching all types of levels) at the moment, and Sentry (sentry.io) for Flask logs for levels ERROR and above.

## How do I add logging to my features?
All logs of level `INFO` and higher will be sent to Logstash. To help Logstash parse the logs, we add a few convenience classes and functions to convert the log messages into a compatible format.

__Example 1__

Use the `UserEventLog` data class to add a *username* and *event type* into the logs. The use of these data classes are not necessary, but only serve as a reminder as how to format the dictionary key values. The reason is the Elastic search is indexing on specific key values. There's no harm in changing these, but some Kibana visualizations may not work as expected if the keys are changed.

- `event_type` is used as a label for aggregation purposes in Kibana. The example below has the `event_type` 'projects create' which can be used as a filter or aggregation point when searching through the logs in Kibana.

```python

@bp.route('/', methods=['POST'])
@auth.login_required
def add_projects():
    ...
    user = g.current_user
    ...
    current_app.logger.info(
        f'User created projects: <{projects.project_name}>',
        extra=UserEventLog(
            username=g.current_user.username, event_type='projects create').to_dict())
```

__Example 2__

When you don't have the username information, another class `EventLog` can be used in place. Again, these classes are not necessary and can be easily replaced with a dictionary as follows: `{event_type='search'}`. 

```python
@bp.route('/viz-search-temp', methods=['POST'])
@jsonify_with_class(SimpleSearchRequest)
def visualizer_search_temp(req: SimpleSearchRequest):
    ...
    current_app.logger.info(
        f'search term: {req.query}', extra=EventLog(event_type='search').to_dict())

    return SuccessResponse(result=results, status_code=200)
```


__Example 3__

This is to demonstrate that you can call the logger without a message. This will have the message value `null` and does not require the `extra` parameter.


```python
current_app.logger.info(
    UserEventLog(username=user.username, event_type='user login').to_dict())
```

__Example 4__

The example here shows that we can pass anything into the dictionary. This is useful if we wanted to add additional information to our logs, but will require some modifications to the indexes in Kibana if we need to aggregate on the new key values.

```python
current_app.logger.info(
    f'some new log info', extra={'a_new_key': 'a new value!'})
```
