## Cypher Query Performance Tips

This document contains a collection of tips/tricks related to Cypher query performance. As a starting point, it is highly recommended to at least skim the following articles:

### General Tips

- You can use the `PROFILE` keyword to inspect the performance of any query. In the Neo4j browser, what you'll mostly be concerned with is the number of [db hits](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/execution-plans/#execution-plans-dbhits):

- Use node labels whenever possible

  - If a query is slow, check if you are using labels (e.g. `(n:Chemical)`), and check the performance of the query after adding them.

- Always use a params object to inject values into a query

  - This is opposed to using python string formatting to insert values into a query. The way Neo4j generates query plans, especially for `UNWIND` statements, it is much better to use the built in parameter syntax for Cypher. For example, changing

    ```python
    query = f"MATCH (n:Chemical) WHERE ID(n)={my_id} RETURN n"
    graph.run(query)
    ```

    to something like

    ```python
    query = "MATCH (n:Chemical) WHERE ID(n)=$my_id RETURN n"
    graph.run(query, {'my_id': my_id})
    ```

- Try not to use node objects as the basis for a search
  - For example, it is better to change
    ```cypher
    MATCH (f)-[:HAS_ASSOCIATION]->(a:Association)-[:HAS_ASSOCIATION]->(t)
    WHERE ID(f)={} AND ID(t)={} AND a.description='{}'
    WITH a AS association
    MATCH (association)-[:HAS_REF]-(r:Reference)-[:HAS_PUBLICATION]-(p:Publication)
    RETURN r AS reference, p AS publication
    ```
    into something like
    ```cypher
    MATCH (f)-[:HAS_ASSOCIATION]->(a:Association)-[:HAS_ASSOCIATION]->(t)
    WHERE ID(f)={} AND ID(t)={} AND a.description='{}'
    WITH ID(a) AS association_id
    MATCH (a:Association)-[:HAS_REF]-(r:Reference)-[:HAS_PUBLICATION]-(p:Publication)
    WHERE ID(a)=association_id
    RETURN r AS reference, p AS publication
    ```
