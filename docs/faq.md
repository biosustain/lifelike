## How do I set up my developer environment?
To build run the application, first create the docker images

__Build__
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

__Run__
```bash
docker-compose up
```
OR the *less verbose version*
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

__(Optional)__
To setup `node_modules` folder for local development, run the following command
```
yarn install
```
__IMPORTANT NOTE!! READ ME__
- If you set up the local development, the `yarn.lock` will update. Do not commit the changes. If we want to install new packages, see [How do I add new packages to package.json](#how-do-i-add-new-packages-to-packagejson)


## How do I add new packages to package.json?
1. Run the following
```
docker-compose exec yarn add <package name>
```

2. Ensure the package has been installed in the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` file

3. Commit the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` file

Why not install it directly via `yarn install` locally? There's a potential for the package manager to use the incorrect binaries between linux and (macOS/Windows).

__Other Notes__
1. Run `docker-compose down` to stop the application.
2. The PostgreSQL database is currently being seeded on start up (after `docker-compose up`) which means you may find the login credentials listed in [here](../appserver/fixtures/seed.json).

## How do I connect to the neo4j container?
```
docker-compose exec database cypher-shell -u neo4j
```

## How do I connect to the postgres container?
```
docker-compose exec pgdatabase psql -U postgres -h pgdatabase -d postgres
```

## How do I debug a running application locally?
This means the application is running and once you hit a certain line in the code
while going through the application UI, the code will break at that point.

To do this, first edit the `docker-compose.yml` file for the `appserver` service. Add the following:

```yml
stdin_open: true
tty: true
```
Next, add the following to the part of the code that you want to break at:

```python
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
```

Restart the application with the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
# seed if needed...
docker attach <service_name> # e.g n4j-appserver
```
To exit out of attach mode, can do either `Ctrl+C` to exit and kill the container. Or `Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Q` to detach without killing. It's also possible to add new breakpoints without stopping the container like that since our setup allows updates to the containers automatically.

## How do I remote ssh into a running container?
In rare occasions where you need to ssh into the container as root: `docker exec -u 0 -it <container_name> bash`.

If you need to edit a file for debugging:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install vim
```

## How do I update database with new changes?
Database migration workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/SBRG/kg-prototypes/blob/master/appserver/migrations/README.md)

## How do I run unit tests for Flask?
To run the unit tests for Flask, use the following commands when Flask is running

```bash
docker-compose exec appserver pytest
```

To run a specific test
```bash
docker-compose exec appserver pytest -k <name of test or file>
```

## How do I run unit tests for Angular?
```bash
docker-compose exec client yarn test
```

## How do I run linting checks?
For the client (Angular) application, use
```bash
docker-compose exec client yarn lint
```

For the server (Flask) application, use
```bash
docker-compose exec appserver pycodestyle .
docker-compose exec appserver mypy .
```

The document located [HERE](./dev/linting.md) also has more tips on a shortcut for performing these linting tasks

## How do I create a postgres schema diagram?
1. To create a schema diagram, first run the application
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Install the `eralchemy` locally. To see the various methods of installing it, please see https://github.com/Alexis-benoist/eralchemy

For macOS users, use
```bash
brew install eralchemy
```

3. Run the following command to generate the schema
```bash
eralchemy -i 'postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres@localhost:5431/postgres' -o docs/dev/schema-current.pdf
```

4. (Optional) Commit the schema update to the repository
