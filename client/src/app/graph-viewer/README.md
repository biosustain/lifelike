# Graph Viewer and Editor

This collection of files implements a framework for a graph editor and viewer.

```typescript
const style = new KnowledgeMapStyle();
const graphCanvas = new CanvasGraphView(canvasTag, {
  nodeRenderStyle: style,
  edgeRenderStyle: style,
  groupRenderStyle: style,
});
graphCanvas.behaviors.add('delete-keyboard-shortcut', new DeleteKeyboardShortcut(graphCanvas), -100);
// ... more behaviors...
graphCanvas.backgroundFill = '#f2f2f2';
graphCanvas.startParentFillResizeListener();
graphCanvas.startAnimationLoop(); // Note: If calling from Angular, call outside Angular with ngZone

// When done:
graphCanvas.destroy();
```

## Reference

- Graph - information about the state of the map and its component. A parsed version of
  the `graph.json` file from map content.
- Graph Entity - an umbrella term for all types of map components -
  current `nodes | edges | groups`.
- Placed Object - boiled down representation of `Entity` responsible for storing information
  relevant for
  the rendering process and the `draw()` function itself.
- Action - encapsulation of user actions that allow undo/redo itself. Used for tracking the history
  of edition in order to implement
  those (undo/redo) mechanism
- Behaviour - responsible for handling events from the user, such as dragging/clicking of the
  canvas/entities.

## Organization

- [renderers/](renderers) - The renderers themselves and the starting point of all this code
  - [graph-view](renderers/graph-view.ts) - Responsible for management of the graph itself. The
    functions here affect the state of
    the `graph` rather than rendering itself. Implements the code responsible for the graph
    manipulation via `GraphAction`.
  - [canvas/canvas-graph-view.ts](renderers/canvas/canvas-graph-view.ts) - Extends `graph-view` with
    code responsible for drawing on the canvas. Stores the render information
    in `[Entity name]RenderStyle`
    objects. Responsible for placing the objects and managing the render cache.
    Responsible for handling canvas events (click/drag, etc.) and calling behaviours.
  - [canvas/renderTree.ts](renderers/canvas/render-tree.ts) - cache storing information about placed
    objects.
  - [behaviours](renderers/canvas/behaviors) - Responsible for reacting to the canvas events (
    mouse/key click, drag, etc.)
- [styles/](styles) - Renderers use style objects to convert graph data into drawing primitives that
  have metrics (width, height, bbox) and draw() methods - placed objects.
- [actions/](actions) - `Actions` abstract user-initiated _actions_ so they can be rolled back or
  redone --
  when you need to record something the user did, create an action and
  call `renderer.execute(action)`.
  Actions affecting multiple entities can be stored together in group action - `Compound Action`. In
  order to enable
  the method to be called from `GraphAction`, its prototype should be added to `GraphActionReceiver`
  class, which is implemented
  by the `graph-view` class (and implemented there).
- [utils/](utils) - Utility methods used by the graph viewer.
  - [canvas/](utils/canvas) - Stores the class files for `PlacedObject`.

## Todo

- [ ] Improve performance to the point that we can render 1,000,000 nodes (or at least a LOT)

  - [x] Automatically decide when not to draw text (text rendering is costly)
  - [ ] Automatically decide when not to draw round node corners (`arc()` is a little expensive)
  - [ ] Cache word wrapping results as much as possible in `TextElement` (text metrics are
        expensive)
  - [ ] Consider drawing nodes onto off-screen canvases in `PlacedNode` and `PlacedEdge` and then
        copying those canvases onto the main canvas when draw() is called for maximum performance
  - [ ] Minimize PlaceNode/PlacedEdge cache invalidation caused by some operations
  - [ ] When zooming or panning, take a screenshot of the canvas and manipulate that, waiting to
        re-draw the whole canvas when zooming has completed
  - [ ] Only re-draw changed portions of the canvas when changing graph data (currently possible!
        we have bboxes)
  - [ ] Only re-draw new portions of the canvas when panning
  - [ ] Use a spatial index or culling to make `getEntityAtMouse()` fast as possible

- [] Improve drawing mechanism
  - [] Add the selection as the last part of the drawing, rather than drawing under the nodes/edges
  - [] Allow users to choose the Z-index of the entities.
