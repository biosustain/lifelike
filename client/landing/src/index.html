          <p>Lifelike has several integrated features that support knowledge mining and
            collaboration among users in the biosciences field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can upload their own structured and unstructured data. The data is annotated in
            real-time using NLP and rule-based techniques allowing it to be contextualized and
            connected to global knowledge. Graph and statistical knowledge mining algorithms can
            then be run across the combined user and global datasets. In this way users can explore
            their own data in the broader context of existing knowledge, discovering extended paths
            comprised of new and previously known relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lifelike supports communication and collaboration by allowing users to create Knowledge
            Maps. These are visual graph documents that can be used informally to take "visual
            notes", or in a more rigorous fashion to create highly curated models that can be
            analyzed with graph algorithms. Knowledge Maps are a great and easy to use tool to
            extract knowledge in a visual fashion by simply dragging entities, text snippets, files
            etc. onto the map. The user can then create new connections between the entities,
            provide evidence for each connection and add notes and links. The map content is very
            rich since the entities retain their meta-data and hyperlinks.</p>

                Lifelike uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and rule-based entity recognition to
                automatically recognize key biological entities such as genes, proteins, diseases,
                chemicals, phenomena, anatomy, proteins, species and relationships between them. It
                also enables ‘on the fly’ custom annotations so users can define additional key
