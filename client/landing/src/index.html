        <p>Knowledge is typically documented using tools like Power Point, Google Slides, Electronic Lab Notebooks or
          with the publishing of papers. Knowledge is therefore mostly shared in an unstructured format, making it
          difficult for humans and computers to consume, understand quickly and integrate with prior knowledge. Lifelike
          addresses this problem with machine learning, natural language processing and knowledge graphs.</p>
        <p>Users can more quickly understand unstructured text, extract key information in a visual format and
          cross-connect it with other sources of knowledge. With the integration of many public research databases and
          articles, users can leverage prior work and increase the return on the investment. With the integration of
          internal databases, Lifelike can connect derived knowledge back to the originating data that resides in
          various applications such ELN/LIMS and other systems. </p>
        <p>Lifelike stores knowledge in a human and machine-readable format enabling researchers and computers to work
          together in understanding and solving complex problems. Researchers can ask questions, generate new
          hypotheses, contextualize experimental data, close knowledge gaps and share knowledge in a structured format.
          With all of that, we hope that Lifelike can facilitate a long-term transition from publishing knowledge as
          unstructured text to publishing structured knowledge graphs, enabling interoperability.</p>
