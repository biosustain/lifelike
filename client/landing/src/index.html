          <p>Knowledge is typically documented using tools like Power Point, Google Slides,
            Electronic Lab Notebooks or
            with the publishing of papers. Knowledge is therefore mostly shared in an unstructured
            format, making it
            difficult for humans and computers to consume, understand quickly and integrate with
            prior knowledge. Lifelike
            addresses this problem with machine learning, natural language processing and knowledge
            graphs.</p>
          <p>Users can more quickly understand unstructured text, extract key information in a
            visual format and
            cross-connect it with other sources of knowledge. With the integration of many public
            research databases and
            articles, users can leverage prior work and increase the return on the investment. With
            the integration of
            internal databases, Lifelike can connect derived knowledge back to the originating data
            that resides in
            various applications such as ELN/LIMS and other systems. </p>
          <p>Lifelike stores knowledge in a human and machine-readable format enabling researchers
            and computers to work
            together in understanding and solving complex problems. Researchers can ask questions,
            generate new
            hypotheses, contextualize experimental data, close knowledge gaps and share knowledge in
            a structured format.
            With all of that, we hope that Lifelike can facilitate a long-term transition from
            publishing knowledge as
            unstructured text to publishing structured knowledge graphs, enabling
            interoperability.</p>
