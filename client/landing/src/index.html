                Lifelike has several integrated features that support knowledge mining and
                collaboration among users in the biosciences field.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users can upload their own structured and unstructured data. The data is annotated
                in real-time using NLP and rule-based techniques allowing it to be contextualized
                and connected to global knowledge. Graph and statistical knowledge mining algorithms
                can then be run across the combined user and global datasets. In this way users can
                explore their own data in the broader context of existing knowledge, discovering
                extended paths comprised of new and previously known relationships.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lifelike supports communication and collaboration by allowing users to create
                Knowledge Maps. These are visual graph documents that can be used informally to take
                "visual notes", or in a more rigorous fashion to create highly curated models that
                can be analyzed with graph algorithms. Knowledge Maps are a great and easy to use
                tool to extract knowledge in a visual fashion by simply dragging entities, text
                snippets, files etc. onto the map. The user can then create new connections between
                the entities, provide evidence for each connection and add notes and links. The map
                content is very rich since the entities retain their meta-data and hyperlinks.

                    Lifelike uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and rule-based entity recognition to

                    between them. It also enables ‘on the fly’ custom annotations so users can
